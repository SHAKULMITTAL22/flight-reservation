================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The method addFlight directly adds attributes to the ModelMap which may include user-controlled data. If any attribute is rendered in a view without proper encoding, it could lead to XSS attacks where malicious scripts are executed in the user's browser.
Solution: Ensure all user-controlled data is properly sanitized or encoded before being passed to the view templates. Use Spring's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS such as using `${fn:escapeXml(someVariable)}` in JSP or `th:text="${data}"` in Thymeleaf.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not perform any validation on the 'flight' object before saving it to the database. This could lead to invalid data being stored, and potentially introduce vulnerabilities like SQL Injection if the underlying ORM is misconfigured or if raw queries are used elsewhere.
Solution: Use Spring's validation API to validate the 'flight' object before proceeding with database operations. Annotate the Flight class with validation constraints and use `@Valid` or `@Validated` on the method parameter in the controller to enforce these constraints.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method does not handle any exceptions that might be thrown during the database operation, potentially leading to default error messages that expose sensitive information about the application's internal workings or database structure.
Solution: Implement exception handling within the method to catch and handle possible exceptions. Log the error internally and return a generic error message to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: The method directly modifies the ModelMap object by adding attributes that might be based on user input, which can be manipulated to alter the state of the application unexpectedly.
Solution: Thoroughly review and sanitize all user inputs that might influence the ModelMap. Consider using a service layer to handle business logic and data manipulation before adding results to the model.

```
Scenario 1: Successful Flight Addition

Details:
  TestName: addFlightWithValidDetails
  Description: This test verifies whether a valid flight object is added successfully to the repository and the confirmation message is set accurately in the model map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the FlightRepository and a Flight object with all necessary details filled. Prepare a ModelMap to capture output attributes.
  Act: Call the addFlight method with the prepared Flight object and ModelMap.
  Assert: Verify that the FlightRepository's save method was called with the correct flight object and that the model map contains the expected success message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the "Flight Added Successfully" message is correctly placed in the model map, ensuring that the method handles successful additions properly and communicates back to the user interface as expected.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the system can handle and acknowledge successful flight entries, which is a core functionality of the application.

Scenario 2: Handling Null Flight Object

Details:
  TestName: addFlightWithNullFlight
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a null Flight object being passed, which should ideally be handled gracefully to avoid application crashes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the FlightRepository and a null Flight object. Prepare a ModelMap to capture output attributes.
  Act: Call the addFlight method with a null Flight object and ModelMap.
  Assert: Verify that the FlightRepository's save method is not called and check for any error messages or flags set in the ModelMap.
Validation:
  This test verifies the method's robustness in handling null inputs, which are common error cases in web applications.
  Ensuring that null inputs do not lead to exceptions or system failures is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of the application.

Scenario 3: Repository Throw Exception on Save

Details:
  TestName: addFlightWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test examines the behavior of the addFlight method when the FlightRepository throws an exception during the save operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the FlightRepository to throw a RuntimeException when the save method is called. Prepare a Flight object with valid details and a ModelMap.
  Act: Call the addFlight method with the Flight object and ModelMap.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown, and verify that no success message is set in the ModelMap.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not incorrectly communicate a successful addition when an error occurs at the database level.
  This scenario is important as it tests the method's error handling capabilities, which help in maintaining data integrity and providing accurate feedback to the user.

Scenario 4: Flight Object with Missing Required Fields

Details:
  TestName: addFlightWithIncompleteDetails
  Description: Tests the method's behavior when the Flight object provided is missing required fields, assuming there are validations or constraints at the repository level that prevent saving incomplete objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the FlightRepository to reject save operations for incomplete objects. Create a Flight object missing required fields, and prepare a ModelMap.
  Act: Call the addFlight method with the incomplete Flight object and ModelMap.
  Assert: Verify that the FlightRepository's save method is not successful and check for error messages in the ModelMap.
Validation:
  This test checks for the method's handling of data integrity issues, ensuring that only complete and valid data is saved.
  It is significant for preventing data corruption and ensuring the reliability of flight information in the system.
