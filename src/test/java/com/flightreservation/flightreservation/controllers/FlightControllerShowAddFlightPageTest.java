================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user input is directly used in web pages without proper sanitization or escaping, it can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Ensure all user input is sanitized or escaped before being embedded in the output HTML. Use frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design such as Thymeleaf or FreeMarker.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If user inputs are concatenated directly into SQL queries, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate queries and access unauthorized data.
Solution: Use PreparedStatement or ORM frameworks like Hibernate which support parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Verbose error messages or stack traces exposed to users can lead to information disclosure, helping attackers gain insights into the backend systems.
Solution: Configure error handling to prevent detailed error messages from being sent to clients. Use a centralized error handling mechanism to manage exceptions and return generic error messages to the users.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Lack of CSRF protection for forms can allow attackers to submit unauthorized requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
Solution: Implement CSRF tokens in every form and validate the token server-side on each submission to prevent CSRF attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: Without restrictions on the number of failed login attempts, an attacker can perform brute-force attacks to guess user credentials.
Solution: Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts. Use CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: Allowing users to upload files without proper validation and sanitization can lead to the execution of malicious files.
Solution: Restrict file types, check file extensions and MIME types, and scan uploaded files for malware. Store files in a directory that is not executable.

Scenario 1: Basic Navigation to Add Flight Page

Details:
  TestName: navigateToAddFlightPage
  Description: This test verifies that the showAddFlightPage method correctly navigates to the "flights/addFlight" view.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the method does not interact with any models or services.
  Act: Call the showAddFlightPage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned view name is "flights/addFlight".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensure that the method returns the correct view name for the navigation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test confirms that users attempting to add a new flight are directed to the correct page, ensuring the application's navigational flow is maintained.

Scenario 2: Consistency of Method Output

Details:
  TestName: consistentOutputForAddFlightPage
  Description: This test checks if repeated invocations of the showAddFlightPage method consistently return the same view name.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required due to the lack of external dependencies.
  Act: Call the showAddFlightPage method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return "flights/addFlight".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the method is stable and returns a consistent result on multiple executions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring consistency in the output of the method under identical conditions is crucial for the reliability of the user interface flow in the application.

Scenario 3: Thread Safety of the Navigation Method

Details:
  TestName: threadSafetyForAddFlightNavigation
  Description: This scenario tests the thread safety of the showAddFlightPage method by invoking it concurrently from multiple threads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up multiple threads to call the showAddFlightPage method.
  Act: Execute all threads and capture their outputs.
  Assert: Verify that all threads return "flights/addFlight" without any errors or inconsistencies.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test aims to confirm that the method can handle multiple simultaneous calls and still function correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Thread safety is critical in a web application environment where multiple users might be interacting with the system concurrently. This test ensures that simultaneous navigation attempts by different admins do not lead to unexpected behaviors or errors.
